## General Part

Q: Describe the term Single Page Application and why it relevant for modern web-applications
A: The term SPA (Single Page Application) covers the functionality of a web page that does not
	have to communicate with the server, each time something on the page would render/re-render.

Q: Describe how SPA's are implemented with React
A: React is a javascript library that uses components to render a webpage without having unnecessary
	contact with the server, and that way making the experience of the user way smoother.

Q: Explain about Routing in React
A: Routing in react is a library used for making navigation in a react application easier, as it
	has different components rendering based on the given URL. It also has existing components
	like <Link> that, together with javascript history (an array list), make you able to use
	the forward and backwards arrows on your browser, again, without unnecessary contact with the
	server.
